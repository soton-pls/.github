# <div align="center"> University of Southampton Programming Language Society

Welcome! You have stumbled upon the University of Southampton's
Programing Language Societies GitHub page!

This society was created for people who are interested in both programming language theory,
and the design and development of programming languages. We aim to allow our members to share their knowledge,
chat with peers and maybe learn a thing or two.

Across the year we will be running:<br>
- Talks and workshops, hosted by both society members and external speakers!<br>
- LangJams, which are Hackathons related to Programming Languages!<br>
- Other fun Programming Language themed Social Events!

Feel free to stay a while and check out our repos, or head to our website / social meda accounts to keep in touch or come and chat with us :)
